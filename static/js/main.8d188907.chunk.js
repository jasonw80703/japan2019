I remember getting out of customs and security, and immediately being presented with the classic Japanese train station open faced food and souvenir shops. Walking through these shops gave me a rush of warm nostalgia and newfound energy after my long flight. My journey across Japan was finally starting and I couldn\u2019t wait to begin. However, before I could depart, there were a couple of things I had to do at the train station.","airport":"First, I had to pick up my pocket wifi. I ordered a Premium Pocket Wi-Fi from Japan Wireless with unlimited data. I brought a receipt and order number and found the counter, where I easily picked up my pocket wifi and then set it up. I quickly informed my family and friends that I arrived safely. Then, I had to take out some cash. I meant to take out $3000 USD in cash, but due to some bad math (which to be fair, I just had a 20+ hour trip), I took out 30000 yen, which was around $300 USD worth. Not wanting to pay ATM and other fees again, I decided to travel with only $300 USD cash on hand for now. Finally, I had to pick up my JR pass which I preordered online. Helpful train employees and plenty of English signs pointed me to the JR office where I picked up my first 30 day JR pass. I would need it to travel from the main airport station to the station near where I booked my first hostel.","survey":"After getting my ticket from New Chitose Airport station to Sapporo station, as I was leaving the JR office, I was approached by a Japanese woman speaking English, asking for a quick survey. I had time to kill before my train, so I did the survey. She asked about my experience at the JR office and of course, I answered very positively. A common theme throughout all of Japan, whether it be ticket offices, restaurants, tourist destinations, shops, or hostels, is that everyone providing a service is extremely polite and friendly. This is one of the things I love about Japan: people have a high level of courtesy (even to foreigners), and everyone seems to do their job with dignity. In exchange for completing the survey, the nice lady gave me a clear binder with images of JR trains on it that I carried along with me the entire trip and eventually brought back home.","hostel":"My first hostel in Japan was called Untapped Hostel. It was a small hostel really close to Kitajuhachijo station, around 20 minutes walk away from Sapporo station. When I arrived at the front desk, a friendly employee named Jim greeted me in English and checked me in. Throughout the trip,  I chose to pay for most hostels that I booked on location, so I paid here with my credit card. After, he showed me to my room in a separate building in the back. There was a very nice common area with a kitchen, piano and tables to work on. There were two showers shared for everyone and a female specific toilet. I had the upper bed of a bed bunk in a seemingly empty room. Here\u2019s a picture!","kalbi":"After unpacking a bit, it was 10pm or so, and I was getting hungry so I went to find my first meal in Japan. Not many restaurants were open nearby but I managed to find a nearby Yakiniku that specializes in Galbi Don. Galbi Don is marinated beef with rice, where don in Japanese means rice bowl. I think the restaurant was Japanese but was selling Korean food (I think the word Galbi and the free kimchi gave it away). So yeah, my first meal in Japan was Korean food.","work_1":"After getting some rest at the hostel the first night, I was excited to start my first real full day in Japan. I began the day early with finding breakfast. This was my first trip of many to convenience stores (or konbini) in Japan. I got a tuna mayonnaise onigiri and bottled black coffee, a typical breakfast for the 2 months to come.","work_2":"Afterwards, I checked in to do some work in the hostel common area. 9 am in Japan was 5 pm in San Francisco, where most of my team works. I also have teammates in Singapore and Mumbai that joined recently around that time, which I used as a good reason for allowing me to  work remotely in Japan. I attended some late meetings we had at the time, and did some work in the hostel common area. My plan for the trip in terms of working remotely was to work early in the morning, throughout the day, and then at night. Working early in the morning and late at night allowed me to collaborate with my San Francisco teammates. Working throughout the day allowed me to travel when the sun was out, occasionally stopping by coffee shops throughout the day to collaborate with my APAC (Asia Pacific) teammates.","work_3":"Looking back, this strategy kept me sane. It helped with the loneliness of travelling alone, and gave me physical rest from walking destination to destination. The flexible work schedule did take a heavy toll on my wallet, as I had to drink a LOT of coffee throughout the trip (stay tuned for a Japan coffee shop tier list and reviews later on). My pocket wifi was great in most locations, and coffee shop or hostel wifis were almost always reliable, meaning I had little difficulty with connecting to the internet. However, the company VPN proved to be a little more than an annoyance, continuingly disconnecting me or having issues connecting in the first place.","daytwo_1":"While working in the common area, I met some new people! I met Liam and Yamayako, a couple from Rhode Island. They were both designers and were moving to Japan soon. At the time, they were doing a biking trip across Japan. Their route actually closely followed my planned route, but they were going by bike which was very impressive. They were very kind and I very surprisingly saw them at a different location in one of the southern cities of Japan later in the trip. I also met Mona, an employee who works at the hostel part time. More about her later.","daytwo_2":"After working until noon, I wanted to explore Sapporo a bit. I went and found my first bowl of hot ramen for lunch. Warmed up, I walked to Sapporo station, taking in everything. I remember the wide main streets divided by small alleys with large hanging signs advertising drinks and cheap food. I remember the streets populated with tiny trucks driving on the left side of the road. I remember the gas stations with the pumps hanging from the ceiling, with employees waiting to pump gas for customers.","daytwo_3":"I was warned that Japan, especially Sapporo, would be cold since I was travelling during the last three months of the year. I didn\u2019t want to pack a warm jacket because it would be heavy to carry all around in Japan for two months. This was my first mistake. The first night was very cold so I needed to buy a winter jacket. Near Sapporo station, I went into a UNIQLO and bought this thick, beige winter jacket. It looked really nice and was reasonably priced but it was a bit heavy duty. I thought it would be fine since I\u2019d be wearing it all the time. This was my second mistake. The further south I travelled, the warmer it got so I wore the jacket maybe only a dozen times.","shiroi_1":"The first main landmark I visited in Sapporo was the Shiroi Koibito Factory. Shiroi Koibito is a famous Japanese chocolate originating from Sapporo but often purchased at duty free airport shops as souvenir gifts when returning home. It is a delicate white chocolate snack that I\u2019ve enjoyed before so I wanted to see the park named after it. The park has a factory within that shows the process of how they make the chocolate. I also attended a tour that I think was intended for children, that showed the evolution of chocolate and some special chocolate related items like decorative cups made especially for hot chocolate.","shiroi_2":"I learned that the name Shiroi Koibito originated from when the founder noticed that the snow flakes outside his home looked like \u201cwhite lovers falling from the sky\u201d where Shiroi Koibito directly translates to \u201cwhite lovers\u201d. I would recommend visiting the park. It seems to be more geared towards children but the tour is very informative and it\u2019s nice to see how the chocolate is made. The tour was led by an employee who spoke only Japanese but they had English subtitles for the video components. You can then purchase some custom Shiroi Koibito chocolates at the gift shop after. I didn\u2019t buy any since I didn\u2019t want to carry chocolate on me this early in the trip.","tower":"It was raining when I took the train back into the city. I carried my umbrella on me so that helped with the rain but the one pair of shoes that I brought with me filled with water easily, wetting my socks. Trying to stay dry, I went to visit the Sapporo Clock Tower near Sapporo Station. The Sapporo Clock Tower is a small museum with exhibits showing the historical development of Sapporo and the building itself. It\u2019s actually the oldest building standing in Sapporo. I learned about the advancements in agriculture and the various people that helped make Sapporo what it is today. The clock tower is still functional and you can see an actual size replica of the main clock upstairs.","beer_factory_1":"Sapporo is known for its famous beer so I had to visit the Sapporo Beer Museum. Later in the trip, I also visited the Kirin Beer Factory and I\u2019ll compare the two when I talk about that one. Sapporo Beer Museum museum is nicely built, the outside with brick and the inside more modernly set. I walked through it alone as opposed to a guided tour, looking at the history of the beer brand. I really enjoyed looking at the changes in the brand logo and advertising over time. The advertising adapted to the time, starting with a more traditional Japanese era to a time with heavier Western influences. They also have panels showing the process of how the beer is made, but it was written in Japanese.","mona_1":"I headed back to my hostel to do some work and read after my long day. I brought along with me Man and His Symbols by Carl Jung, his last work about dreams, symbols, and their importance. While unwinding in the common area, Mona came in and we struck up a conversation. Being half Egyptian and half Japanese, and having lived in both Japan and Egypt, it was interesting to hear her perspective about being \u30cf\u30fc\u30d5 (haafu). We spoke about the similarities and differences about Japanese, Canadian, American and Egyptian culture. We talked about how the Canadian stereotype of ending sentences with \u201ceh\u201d is very similar to how Japanese people sometimes end sentences with \u201c\u306d\u201d, both representing a rhetorical confirmation from the listener. She taught me some of the weird things about the Japanese language and I taught her some of the very annoying rules (and exceptions to those rules) about the English language. It was a nice conversation and we\u2019ve kept in touch briefly afterwards.","mona_2":"That night was my last night in Sapporo. My time in Sapporo was short but it was a welcoming beginning to my trip. I met some nice locals and other travellers, ate some Japanese staples, and explored the peaceful city while easing into the new time zone and lifestyle. I was ready to leave tomorrow for Hakodate, the next leg in my journey. \u3058\u3083\u3042\u306d\u3001\u672d\u5e4c\u3002","headers":{"airport":"Before Leaving the Airport","hostel":"Untapped Hostel","work":"Working in Japan","exploring":"Exploring Sapporo","shiroi_koibito":"Shiroi Koibito Park","clock_tower":"Sapporo Clock Tower","beer_factory":"Sapporo Beer Museum","mona":"Mona"}}')},,,,,,,,,,function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"getting_there":"The morning of October 20th, I woke up early and quietly packed my things so as to not wake up the other hostel stayers in my room. It was too hot to carry everything and wear my new winter jacket so I wrapped it up tight and clipped it to the side of my bag. It was pretty heavy carrying everything but it became easier the more I travelled. I was excited to trade breaking my back with gaining a sweet pair of chiseled calves by the end of the trip. I travelled to Hakodate from Sapporo via JR Rail, which took around four and a half hours. I grabbed a quick bite and coffee from Lotteria before heading to my platform.","jr_1":"Japan Railways (JR) owns the main rail system used by locals and foreigners to get across Japan. The JR Pass I ordered provides transport all over Japan, with access to most railways, local trains, shinkansens and specific JR busses. The pass can be used to also reserve seats on trains, which I highly recommend for travel to busier cities like Osaka and Tokyo. Many times on this trip however, I forgot or was too lazy to reserve a seat and ended up standing between two train cars. JR trains are very fast, pleasant to ride, and a great way to get between cities (with the exception of travelling to Sapporo from Tokyo, in which I would recommend maybe taking a short flight). One can see a diverse set of views including high buildings in larger cities, farmland and waterways, distant mountainous ranges, and loud whistling underground tunnels.","jr_2":"Train stations may be initially daunting, packed with people rushing around finding their platforms and catching their trains. Some stations have dozens of platform signs pointing in all angles. The staff at train stations generally speak decent English so should be of help if needed. Look for the JR logo to know whether you\u2019re in the right area when using the JR pass. Some local trains do not accept the JR Pass and very often I would need to take some of these local trains. I purchased a very useful Suica card which acted as my transit card for these local trains. Once you reach the platform, you may see coloured shapes on the ground next to where you might board. These coloured shapes map to the train coming to that platform. This information should be available on the display near the platform. For instance, the display might show 3 different trains that stop here. The first might have a red circle, the second a blue square, and the third a yellow triangle. If you are taking the first train, line up behind the red circle and patiently wait for your train to arrive.","jr_3":"Most train stations I came upon had food vendors or small konbinis on the platform and in the station as well. They are great for grabbing a drink and snack for your ride. For shorter rides, I would recommend against eating but when you are riding the Shinkansen, which normally has a longer duration, it is generally acceptable to eat. If you need to take a call on a Shinkansen, I would recommend going to the space between cars and taking it there. Be sure to also keep your ticket on you and to seat yourself at the right train car and spot. Finally, if you do purchase the JR Pass, remember that the JR Pass does not qualify for the Nozomi shinkansen line. I actually made the mistake myself of riding the Nozomi line without a ticket and I was told to get off at the next stop.","fort":"One of the main attractions in Hakodate is Fort Gory\u014dkaku: built in 1855, it was once a unique western styled fortress but now is maintained as a historical site. The fort is unique because of its star shaped layout where \u201cGo\u201d means 5 and \u201cRy\u014dkaku\u201d means ridges. The fort is surrounded by a star shaped moat as well that looks incredible from up above. I chose not to pay to go up the observation tower for the view and instead chose to slowly walk through the large park. Fall colours were coming in at the time and the trees inside the park were beautiful. If I had gone in the spring, I would have had the opportunity to view the cherry blossom trees as this location is one of Hokkaido\u2019s best cherry blossom spots. The park was also littered with informational signs in both English and Japanese, explaining the various bridges and buildings that reside inside the park.","bath":"Hakodate is somewhat known for its onsens. There\u2019s a famous onsen near the water that houses a lot of monkeys. However, after reading the reviews for the place, it seemed like not the greatest place to visit as the location was not a comfortable or clean living space for the monkeys. Instead of going to visit and supporting the monkey onsen, I tried to find some onsens to visit myself and found that most onsen in the area required you to stay at their resort or hotel, which was equipped with a nice natural onsen. I was already staying at a hostel so I did not want to spend more money for another living accommodation. Instead, I actually found a public foot bath near Yunokawacho. It sounded a bit vulgar at first but I realized that the high heat of the natural water should clear out any sanitary issues. I rolled up my pants, took off my shoes and socks, and slowly dipped my feet in. The water was clear and piping hot. I recall seeing (or imagining) the veins on my feet looking like they were expanding, almost getting ready to pop. After getting accustomed to the water, I looked up and enjoyed the quiet surroundings of Hakodate. The area was peaceful, with only a few cars driving by on the main road and locals walking around nonchalantly on the sidewalks.","mount":"Known as one of the three best night views in Japan and highly rated by the Michelin Green Guide, Mount Hakodate was a must visit destination in Hakodate. I took a local bus to get to the foot of the main street to walk up to the Hakodateyama Ropeway and slowly walked uphill towards it. When I got near however, it seemed that the ropeway was closed due to construction. Luckily, they set up a shuttle service that brought visitors up to the mountain. The mountain was absolutely stunning on that clear night. The rows of coloured lights illuminated the city below, stretching far into the horizon. The chilly night winds were refreshing, helping me stay awake and with overcoming my jet lag. There is a little fenced outdoor area you can go to snap some pictures, and a little store in the building as well.","church":"Near the street that goes up to the Hakodateyama Ropeway, there is a Russian Orthodox church. Created in the 19th century, the western styled architecture is a rare sight amongst the small Japanese homes and rectangular buildings. I visited at night, where it was brightly lit up with large ground lights. I also visited a Catholic church nearby at night. It was locked up at night but I was content with walking around, looking at the exterior. Similar to the mountain and the Orthodox church, the area was very serene and peaceful.","soba":"I wanted to leave most of the food related writing in the miscellaneous food section but I believe this place deserved a shout out. Soba is a thin Japanese noodle made of buckwheat primarily, normally eaten cold with a dipping broth, or hot in some soup. Soba noodles have a distinct taste that I would characterize as \u201cwheaty\u201d and not as soft as other noodles like udon or ramen noodles.  I enjoyed a lot of soba on my trip, ranging from standing soba shops that sell soba for cheap, to expensive shops that I had to wait half an hour for. In between, there\u2019s Yataraya, a small mom and pop soba shop located close to Tune Hakodate, the hostel I stayed at. The shop seated maybe two dozen people at most, had some small ornaments and toys on display, and had the local Japanese news playing on their small hanging TV. Their menu was entirely in Japanese, but I was able to read at least the words for tempura, soba, and hot so I was able to order a well priced hot tempura soba. They poured me some pleasant Japanese green tea while I waited as well. The soba noodles, soup, and shrimp tempura were perfect here. The noodles had the right firmness, the soup was flavourful but light enough to drink, and the shrimp tempura were large and crispy. I highly recommend trying some soba noodles in Japan if you haven\u2019t before.","conc":"I enjoyed Hakodate a lot. The place I stayed at wasn\u2019t as bustling as Sapporo, but it had a lot of places to visit and things to do. I stayed there for two whole days and I felt like it was a decent amount of time. I wrote some stuff down about Hakodate when I was leaving. I wrote about how I saw a lot of old Japanese people, the garbage trucks playing music, and that there were very few trash cans out on the streets, but also no litter on the ground. Hakodate is where I defeated my jetlag (kind of), and also where I became more comfortable with taking local busses in Japan. As the last place in Hokkaido before I head inwards to the main island of Japan, I realized that I might have spent too little time here. I\u2019ll be sure to explore more of Hokkaido next time, including the snowy ski slopes in Sapporo and the natural scenes of geothermal hot springs and volcanoes.","headers":{"jr":"Japan Railways","fort":"Hakodate Gory\u014dkaku","bath":"Yunokawa Foot Bath","mountain":"Mount Hakodate","church":"Churches","soba":"Soba"}}')},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"ticket":"With the JR Pass, you can get assigned seating to guarantee a seat.

Toiletries were bare, packing: toothbrush, toothpaste, nail cutter, face wash, hairbands, and a small and large towel. In terms of clothes, I brought enough clothes to last myself a week, with the intention of buying clothes in Japan if needed. I packed 5 shirts, one long pair of pants, some shorts, a hat, and my backup glasses. In terms of miscellaneous items, I also brought a coin purse (because I was going to use a lot of cash), a notebook and pen (for journaling), an umbrella, my camera to take pictures, some elastic bands, plastic bags, the pocket Wi-Fi receipt, and my JR exchange passes that I preordered as well.","para_2":"A note about the JR pass: the maximum length JR pass is only 21 days and I was going to be travelling for around double that period, so I preordered two passes with specified dates.

I waited around half an hour before I was seated inside right in front of where the chefs make the food. The interior is warm and filled with dark wood, giving a nice homey feeling. You can see the chefs cook the curry and prepare everything from scratch. The soup curry was hearty, full of meat and vegetables, and generally very delicious. It had a large meatball, potatoes, carrots, eggplant, spinach, eggs and was served with a bowl of rice. I would highly recommend it if you visit Sapporo!","recommend":true,"images":["soupcurry1","soupcurry2","soupcurry3","soupcurry4"]},{"name":"Konbini Onigiri","name_jp":"\u304a\u306b\u304e\u308a","rating":5,"restaurant":"7/11","review":"Konbinis (or convenience stores) are found everywhere throughout Japan.

Over time, I grew to appreciate the simplicity, craft and health benefits of soba noodles. I normally enjoy a nice cold soba with the classic dipping sauce with green onions. At Yataraya, I ordered a hot soba soup with tempura. The soup was extremely flavourful, made of a simple yet elegant shoyu and homemade dashi broth. The tempura was cleanly fried, providing great contrast to the texture of the firm soba noodles.
