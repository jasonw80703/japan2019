    "about": "Hi, this is Jason Wang. 4 months after travelling north to south in Japan, I’ve decided to document the trip. The primary reason was due to my fear of losing the small journal I carried around throughout the entire trip. But I also realized I should document this before I forget my feelings or wandering thoughts on the trip. This blog will be divided by location, with images littered throughout to provide more context. I hope to re-invoke the experiences of my first time travelling solo for a long period of time and reflect on the experience in this writing process."
