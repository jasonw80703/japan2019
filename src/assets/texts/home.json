    "about": "4 months after travelling north to south in Japan, I’ve decided to document the trip. The primary reason was due to my fear of losing the small journal I carried around throughout the entire trip. But I also realized I should document this before my feelings or wandering thoughts on the trip disappear from my memory. This telling will be divided by city, with images littered throughout to provide more context. Outside of that, there isn’t necessarily any proper structure, but the random recollections should be in chronological order. I hope to re-invoke the experiences of my first time travelling solo for a long period of time and reflect on the experience in this writing process.",
