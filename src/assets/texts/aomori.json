  "getting_there_1": "Aomori was my first stop in the main Japanese island of Honshū where I would remain for the rest of the journey. Travelling between Hokkaido and Honshū can be done via ferry or underwater tunnel. The Seikan Tunnel is the world’s longest tunnel with an underwater segment, and the method I took to reach the main island. Instead of departing from the main JR Hakodate station that I arrived at, I went to the closer but smaller Goryōkaku Station to transfer to Shin-Hakodate Hokuto Station, where I took the Shinkansen to Aomori. Goryōkaku Station is small and ostensibly less travelled by foreigners as the station staff spoke no English, despite accepting my JR pass. I missed my earlier train but luckily (and surprisingly), there was a Starbucks near the station (be sure to check out the coffee shop tier list in the miscellaneous dropdown). I did some work using the wonderful free Starbucks wifi and waited for my train to arrive.",
  "getting_there_2": "My train for the Hokkaido Shinkansen had a memorable bright teal colour, with a pink stripe fully across. Settled into my seat, I continued to try to do work on the train with my pocket wifi but the train kept going underground or underwater, breaking my connection. There are many bullet train systems around the world but the Japanese Shinkansen is particular. There has not been a single passenger injury or fatality while being in operation for over half a century. The ride is smooth, swift and incredibly convenient for locals and foreigners alike. Travelling from Shin Hakodate Hokuto to Shin Aomori took little more than an hour only.",
  "explore_1": "There weren’t many good options for hostels in Aomori near the water where I wanted to stay, but I was able to find a cheap hostel on the main downtown strip in Aomori. I arrived at Art hotel Color Aomori a bit early but they let me check in early. The downtown street was very quiet, with only a few locals here or there. The hotel was equally empty, not seeing any other people outside of the front desk staff and the room cleaners. The room was very carefully cleaned and the bed was queen size, a welcome sight. Walking around downtown Aomori midday to explore, I found that the area didn’t have much to do. Stores were small and mostly closed, and not many restaurants were open. I did spot this house drying some daikon radishes outside their window which was neat.",
  "explore_2": "One nice thing about my hotel was that it is very close to Mutsu Bay. I walked to the pier and sat down on a bench to watch the water for a while. The pier was very large, with huge walkways but few people since it was getting late. When going out to explore, I often brought my camera and notebook with a pen. I was uncomfortable taking pictures in very local spots because I felt like I was intruding or causing a disturbance for the locals that lived there. Aomori was very local but felt deserted at times, offering ample opportunity to snap pictures and journal or draw outside.",
  "explore_3": "On the pier stands an interesting architectural building: this immense triangular tower. This looming tower is the Aomori Tourist Information Center or ASPAM. The shape comes from the letter “A” in Aomori. The 15 floor building has stores on the lower floors that sell seemingly every apple product such as apple juice, cider, apple pies, and apple flavoured ice cream. This is because Aomori is known for their apples, in which the city produces the most apples in all of Japan. They have apple farms so apple picking can be done here, and they even have apple hot springs where one can enjoy the heat of a nice natural bath while bobbing for apples! On upper floors, there are some local shops and entertainment exhibits, explaining the history and culture of Aomori. Finally, there is an observation desk with a nice view of the water.",
