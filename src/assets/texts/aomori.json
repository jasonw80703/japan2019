  "getting_there_1": "Aomori was my first stop in the main Japanese island of Honshū where I would remain for the rest of the journey. Travelling between Hokkaido and Honshū can be done via ferry or underwater tunnel. The Seikan Tunnel is the world’s longest tunnel with an underwater segment, and the method I took to reach the main island. Instead of departing from the main JR Hakodate station that I arrived at, I went to the closer but smaller Goryōkaku Station to transfer to Shin-Hakodate Hokuto Station, where I took the Shinkansen to Aomori. Goryōkaku Station is small and ostensibly less travelled by foreigners as the station staff spoke no English, despite accepting my JR pass. I missed my earlier train but luckily (and surprisingly), there was a Starbucks near the station (be sure to check out the coffee shop tier list in the miscellaneous dropdown). I did some work using the wonderful free Starbucks wifi and waited for my train to arrive.",
  "getting_there_2": "My train for the Hokkaido Shinkansen had a memorable bright teal colour, with a pink stripe fully across. Settled into my seat, I continued to try to do work on the train with my pocket wifi but the train kept going underground or underwater, breaking my connection. There are many bullet train systems around the world but the Japanese Shinkansen is particular. There has not been a single passenger injury or fatality while being in operation for over half a century. The ride is smooth, swift and incredibly convenient for locals and foreigners alike. Travelling from Shin Hakodate Hokuto to Shin Aomori took little more than an hour only."
