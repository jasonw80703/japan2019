  "getting_there": "The morning of October 20th, I woke up early and quietly packed my things so as to not wake up the other hostel stayers in my room. It was too hot to carry everything and wear my new winter jacket so I wrapped it up tight and clipped it to the side of my bag. It was pretty heavy carrying everything but it became easier and easier the more I travelled. I was excited to trade breaking my back with gaining a sweet pair of chiseled calves by the end of the trip. I travelled to Hakodate from Sapporo via JR Rail, which took around four and a half hours. I grabbed a quick bite and coffee from Lotteria before heading to my platform.",
