  "getting_there": "The morning of October 20th, I woke up early and quietly packed my things so as to not wake up the other hostel stayers in my room. It was too hot to carry everything and wear my new winter jacket so I wrapped it up tight and clipped it to the side of my bag. It was pretty heavy carrying everything but it became easier the more I travelled. I was excited to trade breaking my back with gaining a sweet pair of chiseled calves by the end of the trip. I travelled to Hakodate from Sapporo via JR Rail, which took around four and a half hours. I grabbed a quick bite and coffee from Lotteria before heading to my platform.",
  "jr_1": "Japan Railways (JR) owns the main rail system used by locals and foreigners to get across Japan. The JR Pass I ordered provides transport all over Japan, with access to most railways, local trains, shinkansens and specific JR busses. The pass can be used to also reserve seats on trains, which I highly recommend for travel to busier cities like Osaka and Tokyo. Many times on this trip however, I forgot or was too lazy to reserve a seat and ended up standing between two train cars. JR trains are very fast, pleasant to ride, and a great way to get between cities (with the exception of travelling to Sapporo from Tokyo, in which I would recommend maybe taking a short flight). One can see a diverse set of views including high buildings in larger cities, farmland and waterways, distant mountainous ranges, and loud whistling underground tunnels.",
  "jr_2": "Train stations may be initially daunting, packed with people rushing around finding their platforms and catching their trains. Some stations have dozens of platform signs pointing in all angles. The staff at train stations generally speak decent English so should be of help if needed. Look for the JR logo to know whether you’re in the right area when using the JR pass. Some local trains do not accept the JR Pass and very often I would need to take some of these local trains. I purchased a very useful Suica card which acted as my transit card for these local trains. Once you reach the platform, you may see coloured shapes on the ground next to where you might board. These coloured shapes map to the train coming to that platform. This information should be available on the display near the platform. For instance, the display might show 3 different trains that stop here. The first might have a red circle, the second a blue square, and the third a yellow triangle. If you are taking the first train, line up behind the red circle and patiently wait for your train to arrive.",
  "jr_3": "Most train stations I came upon had food vendors or small konbinis on the platform and in the station as well. They are great for grabbing a drink and snack for your ride. For shorter rides, I would recommend against eating but when you are riding the Shinkansen, which normally has a longer duration, it is generally acceptable to eat. If you need to take a call on a Shinkansen, I would recommend going to the space between cars and taking it there. Be sure to also keep your ticket on you and to seat yourself at the right train car and spot. Finally, if you do purchase the JR Pass, remember that the JR Pass does not qualify for the Nozomi shinkansen line. I actually made the mistake myself of riding the Nozomi line without a ticket and I was told to get off at the next stop.",
  "fort": "One of the main attractions in Hakodate is Fort Goryōkaku: built in 1855, it was once a unique western styled fortress but now is maintained as a historical site. The fort is unique because of its star shaped layout where “Go” means 5 and “Ryōkaku” means ridges. The fort is surrounded by a star shaped moat as well that looks incredible from up above. I chose not to pay to go up the observation tower for the view and instead chose to slowly walk through the large park. Fall colours were coming in at the time and the trees inside the park were beautiful. If I had gone in the spring, I would have had the opportunity to view the cherry blossom trees as this location is one of Hokkaido’s best cherry blossom spots. The park was also littered with informational signs in both English and Japanese, explaining the various bridges and buildings that reside inside the park.",
  "bath": "Hakodate is somewhat known for its onsens. There’s a famous onsen near the water that houses a lot of monkeys. However, after reading the reviews for the place, it seemed like not the greatest place to visit as the location was not a comfortable or clean living space for the monkeys. Instead of going to visit and supporting the monkey onsen, I tried to find some onsens to visit myself and found that most onsen in the area required you to stay at their resort or hotel, which was equipped with a nice natural onsen. I was already staying at a hostel so I did not want to spend more money for another living accommodation. Instead, I actually found a public foot bath near Yunokawacho. It sounded a bit vulgar at first but I realized that the high heat of the natural water should clear out any sanitary issues. I rolled up my pants, took off my shoes and socks, and slowly dipped my feet in. The water was clear and piping hot. I recall seeing (or imagining) the veins on my feet looking like they were expanding, almost getting ready to pop. After getting accustomed to the water, I looked up and enjoyed the quiet surroundings of Hakodate. The area was peaceful, with only a few cars driving by on the main road and locals walking around nonchalantly on the sidewalks.",
  "mount": "Known as one of the three best night views in Japan and highly rated by the Michelin Green Guide, Mount Hakodate was a must visit destination in Hakodate. I took a local bus to get to the foot of the main street to walk up to the Hakodateyama Ropeway and slowly walked uphill towards it. When I got near however, it seemed that the ropeway was closed due to construction. Luckily, they set up a shuttle service that brought visitors up to the mountain. The mountain was absolutely stunning on that clear night. The rows of coloured lights illuminated the city below, stretching far into the horizon. The chilly night winds were refreshing, helping me stay awake and with overcoming my jet lag. There is a little fenced outdoor area you can go to snap some pictures, and a little store in the building as well.",
  "church": "Near the street that goes up to the Hakodateyama Ropeway, there is a Russian Orthodox church. Created in the 19th century, the western styled architecture is a rare sight amongst the small Japanese homes and rectangular buildings. I visited at night, where it was brightly lit up with large ground lights. I also visited a Catholic church nearby at night. It was locked up at night but I was content with walking around, looking at the exterior. Similar to the mountain and the Orthodox church, the area was very serene and peaceful.",
  "soba": "I wanted to leave most of the food related writing in the miscellaneous food section but I believe this place deserved a shout out. Soba is a thin Japanese noodle made of buckwheat primarily, normally eaten cold with a dipping broth, or hot in some soup. Soba noodles have a distinct taste that I would characterize as “wheaty” and not as soft as other noodles like udon or ramen noodles.  I enjoyed a lot of soba on my trip, ranging from standing soba shops that sell soba for cheap, to expensive shops that I had to wait half an hour for. In between, there’s Yataraya, a small mom and pop soba shop located close to Tune Hakodate, the hostel I stayed at. The shop seated maybe two dozen people at most, had some small ornaments and toys on display, and had the local Japanese news playing on their small hanging TV. Their menu was entirely in Japanese, but I was able to read at least the words for tempura, soba, and hot so I was able to order a well priced hot tempura soba. They poured me some pleasant Japanese green tea while I waited as well. The soba noodles, soup, and shrimp tempura were perfect here. The noodles had the right firmness, the soup was flavourful but light enough to drink, and the shrimp tempura were large and crispy. I highly recommend trying some soba noodles in Japan if you haven’t before.",
  "conc": "I enjoyed Hakodate a lot. The place I stayed at wasn’t as bustling as Sapporo, but it had a lot of places to visit and things to do. I stayed there for two whole days and I felt like it was a decent amount of time. I wrote some stuff down about Hakodate when I was leaving. I wrote about how I saw a lot of old Japanese people, the garbage trucks playing music, and that there were very few trash cans out on the streets, but also no litter on the ground. Hakodate is where I defeated my jetlag (kind of), and also where I became more comfortable with taking local busses in Japan. As the last place in Hokkaido before I head inwards to the main island of Japan, I realized that I might have spent too little time here. I’ll be sure to explore more of Hokkaido next time, including the snowy ski slopes in Sapporo and the natural scenes of geothermal hot springs and volcanoes.",
