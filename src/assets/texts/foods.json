        "review": "This was my first meal in Japan. It was cheap, quick and Korean. At the time, I was very hungry so I would have rated it a 3 star meal but looking back, it was pretty disappointing for my first meal. The amount of beef was pretty small and the quality was not great either (compared to beef later on in the trip). However, they gave free kimchi, adding a nice kick to the meal.",

        "review": "I was very excited to have my first meal of ramen in Japan. This place was close to my hostel and I remember having to brush aside this hanging cloth to enter. I ordered their signature miso ramen and it was delicious. They throw in a lot of scallions and the pork belly was so soft. The broth is full of umami and piping hot, warming me up and giving me energy for my day of travelling ahead.",
