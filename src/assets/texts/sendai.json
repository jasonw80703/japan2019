  "intro": "Sendai, my next location, is not far from Ishinomaki. As the largest city in the north west Tōhoku region of the main island, I planned to visit and sightsee many things in this city. Waking up early bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I left my secluded airbnb in the countryside and set my destination to my next, very modern accommodation: ORIT Hostel & Cafe+Bar Lounge in Sendai. I arrived before check in time as usual, so I set up my little work station at a Tully’s Coffee and did some work there. ORIT Hostel was conveniently near the main Sendai JR station so after dropping off my belongings, I explored the area. I visited the Shonen Jump Sendai shop, the Pokemon center, and the AER observation deck. The AER is one of the tallest buildings in the Tōhoku region, and it was a beautiful day when I visited so the view from the top was amazing."
