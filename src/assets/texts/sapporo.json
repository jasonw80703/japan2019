  "para_1": "I landed in New Chitose Airport, Sapporo around midday. I remember getting out of customs and security, and immediately being presented with the classic Japanese train station open faced food and souvenir shops. Walking through these shops gave me a rush of warm nostalgia and newfound energy after my long flight. Before I could depart, there were a couple of things I had to do at the train station.",
  "para_2": "First, I had to pick up my pocket wifi. I ordered a Premium Pocket Wi-Fi from Japan Wireless with unlimited data. I brought a receipt and order number and found the counter, picking up my pocket wifi. I quickly informed my family and friends that I arrived safely. Then, I had to pick up my JR pass which I preordered online. Lots of English signs and helpful train employees pointed me to the JR office where I picked up my first 30 day JR pass. I would need it to travel from the main airport station to the station near where I booked my first hostel.",
  "para_3": "After getting my ticket from New Chitose Airport station to Sapporo station, as I was leaving the JR office, I was approached by a Japanese woman speaking English, asking for a quick survey. I had time to kill before my train, so I did the survey. She asked about my experience at the JR office and of course, I answered very positively. A common theme throughout all of Japan, whether it be ticket offices, restaurants, tourist destinations, shops, or hostels, is that everyone providing a service is extremely polite. In exchange for completing the survey, the nice lady gave me a clear binder with images of JR trains on it."
