  "intro": "I landed in New Chitose Airport, Sapporo around midday. I remember getting out of customs and security, and immediately being presented with the classic Japanese train station open faced food and souvenir shops. Walking through these shops gave me a rush of warm nostalgia and newfound energy after my long flight. My journey across Japan was finally starting and I couldn’t wait to begin. However, before I could depart, there were a couple of things I had to do at the train station.",
  "airport": "First, I had to pick up my pocket wifi. I ordered a Premium Pocket Wi-Fi from Japan Wireless with unlimited data. I brought a receipt and order number and found the counter, where I easily picked up my pocket wifi and then set it up. I quickly informed my family and friends that I arrived safely. Then, I had to take out some cash. I meant to take out $3000 USD in cash, but due to some bad math (which to be fair, I just had a 20+ hour trip), I took out 30000 yen, which was around $300 USD worth. Not wanting to pay ATM and other fees again, I decided to travel with only $300 USD cash on hand for now. Finally, I had to pick up my JR pass which I preordered online. Helpful train employees and plenty of English signs pointed me to the JR office where I picked up my first 30 day JR pass. I would need it to travel from the main airport station to the station near where I booked my first hostel.",
  "survey": "After getting my ticket from New Chitose Airport station to Sapporo station, as I was leaving the JR office, I was approached by a Japanese woman speaking English, asking for a quick survey. I had time to kill before my train, so I did the survey. She asked about my experience at the JR office and of course, I answered very positively. A common theme throughout all of Japan, whether it be ticket offices, restaurants, tourist destinations, shops, or hostels, is that everyone providing a service is extremely polite and friendly. This is one of the things I love about Japan: people have a high level of courtesy (even to foreigners), and everyone seems to do their job with dignity. In exchange for completing the survey, the nice lady gave me a clear binder with images of JR trains on it that I carried along with me the entire trip and eventually brought back home.",
  "hostel": "My first hostel in Japan was called Untapped Hostel. It was a small hostel really close to Kitajuhachijo station, around 20 minutes walk away from Sapporo station. When I arrived at the front desk, a friendly employee named Jim greeted me in English and checked me in. Throughout the trip,  I chose to pay for most hostels that I booked on location, so I paid here with my credit card. After, he showed me to my room in a separate building in the back. There was a very nice common area with a kitchen, piano and tables to work on. There were two showers shared for everyone and a female specific toilet. I had the upper bed of a bed bunk in a seemingly empty room. Here’s a picture!",
  "kalbi": "After unpacking a bit, it was 10pm or so, and I was getting hungry so I went to find my first meal in Japan. Not many restaurants were open nearby but I managed to find a nearby Yakiniku that specializes in Galbi Don. Galbi Don is marinated beef with rice, where don in Japanese means rice bowl. I think the restaurant was Japanese but was selling Korean food (I think the word Galbi and the free kimchi gave it away). So yeah, my first meal in Japan was Korean food.",
  "work_1": "After getting some rest at the hostel the first night, I was excited to start my first real full day in Japan. I began the day early with finding breakfast. This was my first trip of many to convenience stores (or konbini) in Japan. I got a tuna mayonnaise onigiri and bottled black coffee, a typical breakfast for the 2 months to come.",
  "work_2": "Afterwards, I checked in to do some work in the hostel common area. 9 am in Japan was 5 pm in San Francisco, where most of my team works. I also have teammates in Singapore and Mumbai that joined recently around that time, which I used as a good reason for allowing me to  work remotely in Japan. I attended some late meetings we had at the time, and did some work in the hostel common area. My plan for the trip in terms of working remotely was to work early in the morning, throughout the day, and then at night. Working early in the morning and late at night allowed me to collaborate with my San Francisco teammates. Working throughout the day allowed me to travel when the sun was out, occasionally stopping by coffee shops throughout the day to collaborate with my APAC (Asia Pacific) teammates.",
  "work_3": "Looking back, this strategy kept me sane. It helped with the loneliness of travelling alone, and gave me physical rest from walking destination to destination. The flexible work schedule did take a heavy toll on my wallet, as I had to drink a LOT of coffee throughout the trip (stay tuned for a Japan coffee shop tier list and reviews later on). My pocket wifi was great in most locations, and coffee shop or hostel wifis were almost always reliable, meaning I had little difficulty with connecting to the internet. However, the company VPN proved to be a little more than an annoyance, continuingly disconnecting me or having issues connecting in the first place.",
  "daytwo_1": "While working in the common area, I met some new people! I met Liam and Yamayako, a couple from Rhode Island. They were both designers and were moving to Japan soon. At the time, they were doing a biking trip across Japan. Their route actually closely followed my planned route, but they were going by bike which was very impressive. They were very kind and I very surprisingly saw them at a different location in one of the southern cities of Japan later in the trip. I also met Mona, an employee who works at the hostel part time. More about her later.",
  "daytwo_2": "After working until noon, I wanted to explore Sapporo a bit. I went and found my first bowl of hot ramen for lunch. Warmed up, I walked to Sapporo station, taking in everything. I remember the wide main streets divided by small alleys with large hanging signs advertising drinks and cheap food. I remember the streets populated with tiny trucks driving on the left side of the road. I remember the gas stations with the pumps hanging from the ceiling, with employees waiting to pump gas for customers.",
  "daytwo_3": "I was warned that Japan, especially Sapporo, would be cold since I was travelling during the last three months of the year. I didn’t want to pack a warm jacket because it would be heavy to carry all around in Japan for two months. This was my first mistake. The first night was very cold so I needed to buy a winter jacket. Near Sapporo station, I went into a UNIQLO and bought this thick, beige winter jacket. It looked really nice and was reasonably priced but it was a bit heavy duty. I thought it would be fine since I’d be wearing it all the time. This was my second mistake. The further south I travelled, the warmer it got so I wore the jacket maybe only a dozen times.",
  "shiroi_1": "The first main landmark I visited in Sapporo was the Shiroi Koibito Factory. Shiroi Koibito is a famous Japanese chocolate originating from Sapporo but often purchased at duty free airport shops as souvenir gifts when returning home. It is a delicate white chocolate snack that I’ve enjoyed before so I wanted to see the park named after it. The park has a factory within that shows the process of how they make the chocolate. I also attended a tour that I think was intended for children, that showed the evolution of chocolate and some special chocolate related items like decorative cups made especially for hot chocolate.",
  "shiroi_2": "I learned that the name Shiroi Koibito originated from when the founder noticed that the snow flakes outside his home looked like “white lovers falling from the sky” where Shiroi Koibito directly translates to “white lovers”. I would recommend visiting the park. It seems to be more geared towards children but the tour is very informative and it’s nice to see how the chocolate is made. The tour was led by an employee who spoke only Japanese but they had English subtitles for the video components. You can then purchase some custom Shiroi Koibito chocolates at the gift shop after. I didn’t buy any since I didn’t want to carry chocolate on me this early in the trip.",
  "tower": "It was raining when I took the train back into the city. I carried my umbrella on me so that helped with the rain but the one pair of shoes that I brought with me filled with water easily, wetting my socks. Trying to stay dry, I went to visit the Sapporo Clock Tower near Sapporo Station. The Sapporo Clock Tower is a small museum with exhibits showing the historical development of Sapporo and the building itself. It’s actually the oldest building standing in Sapporo. I learned about the advancements in agriculture and the various people that helped make Sapporo what it is today. The clock tower is still functional and you can see an actual size replica of the main clock upstairs.",
  "beer_factory_1": "Sapporo is known for its famous beer so I had to visit the Sapporo Beer Museum. Later in the trip, I also visited the Kirin Beer Factory and I’ll compare the two when I talk about that one. Sapporo Beer Museum museum is nicely built, the outside with brick and the inside more modernly set. I walked through it alone as opposed to a guided tour, looking at the history of the beer brand. I really enjoyed looking at the changes in the brand logo and advertising over time. The advertising adapted to the time, starting with a more traditional Japanese era to a time with heavier Western influences. They also have panels showing the process of how the beer is made, but it was written in Japanese.",
  "mona_1": "I headed back to my hostel to do some work and read after my long day. I brought along with me Man and His Symbols by Carl Jung, his last work about dreams, symbols, and their importance. While unwinding in the common area, Mona came in and we struck up a conversation. Being half Egyptian and half Japanese, and having lived in both Japan and Egypt, it was interesting to hear her perspective about being ハーフ (haafu). We spoke about the similarities and differences about Japanese, Canadian, American and Egyptian culture. We talked about how the Canadian stereotype of ending sentences with “eh” is very similar to how Japanese people sometimes end sentences with “ね”, both representing a rhetorical confirmation from the listener. She taught me some of the weird things about the Japanese language and I taught her some of the very annoying rules (and exceptions to those rules) about the English language. It was a nice conversation and we’ve kept in touch briefly afterwards.",
  "mona_2": "That night was my last night in Sapporo. My time in Sapporo was short but it was a welcoming beginning to my trip. I met some nice locals and other travellers, ate some Japanese staples, and explored the peaceful city while easing into the new time zone and lifestyle. I was ready to leave tomorrow for Hakodate, the next leg in my journey. じゃあね、札幌。",
