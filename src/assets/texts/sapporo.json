  "intro": "I landed in New Chitose Airport, Sapporo around midday. I remember getting out of customs and security, and immediately being presented with the classic Japanese train station open faced food and souvenir shops. Walking through these shops gave me a rush of warm nostalgia and newfound energy after my long flight. My journey was finally starting and I couldn’t wait to begin. However, before I could depart, there were a couple of things I had to do at the train station.",
  "airport": "First, I had to pick up my pocket wifi. I ordered a Premium Pocket Wi-Fi from Japan Wireless with unlimited data. I brought a receipt and order number and found the counter, where I easily picked up my pocket wifi and then set it up. I quickly informed my family and friends that I arrived safely. Then, I had to take out some cash. I meant to take out $3000 USD in cash, but due to some bad math (which to be fair, I just had a 20+ hour trip), I took out 30000 yen, which was around $300 USD worth. Not wanting to pay ATM and other fees again, I decided to travel with only $300 USD cash on hand for now. Finally, I had to pick up my JR pass which I preordered online. Helpful train employees and plenty of English signs pointed me to the JR office where I picked up my first 30 day JR pass. I would need it to travel from the main airport station to the station near where I booked my first hostel.",
  "survey": "After getting my ticket from New Chitose Airport station to Sapporo station, as I was leaving the JR office, I was approached by a Japanese woman speaking English, asking for a quick survey. I had time to kill before my train, so I did the survey. She asked about my experience at the JR office and of course, I answered very positively. A common theme throughout all of Japan, whether it be ticket offices, restaurants, tourist destinations, shops, or hostels, is that everyone providing a service is extremely polite and friendly. This is one of the things I love about Japan: people have a high level of courtesy (even to foreigners), and everyone seems to do their job with dignity. In exchange for completing the survey, the nice lady gave me a clear binder with images of JR trains on it that I carried along with me the entire trip and eventually brought back home.",
  "hostel": "My first hostel in Japan was called Untapped Hostel. It was a small hostel really close to Kitajuhachijo station, around 10 minutes walk away from Sapporo station. When I arrived at the front desk, a friendly employee named Jim greeted me in English and checked me in. Throughout the trip,  I chose to pay for most hostels that I booked on location, so I paid here with my credit card. After, he showed me to my room in a separate building in the back. There was a very nice common area with a kitchen, piano and tables to work on. There were two showers shared for everyone and a female specific toilet. I had the upper bed of a bed bunk in a seemingly empty room. Here’s a picture!",
  "kalbi": "After unpacking a bit, it was 10pm or so, and I was getting hungry so I went to find my first meal in Japan. Not many restaurants were open nearby but I managed to find a nearby Yakiniku that specializes in Galbi Don. Galbi Don is marinated beef with rice, where don in Japanese means rice bowl. I think the restaurant was Japanese but was selling Korean food (I think the word Galbi and the free kimchi gave it away). So yeah, my first meal in Japan was Korean food.",
  "work_1": "After getting some rest at the hostel the first night, I was excited to start my first real full day in Japan. I began the day with checking in on work. 9 am in Japan was 5 pm in San Francisco, where most of my team works. I also have teammates in Singapore and Mumbai that joined recently around that time, which I used as a good reason for allowing me to  work remotely in Japan. I attended some late meetings we had at the time, and did some work in the hostel common area. My plan for the trip in terms of working remotely was to work early in the morning, throughout the day, and then at night. Working early in the morning and late at night allowed me to collaborate with my San Francisco teammates. Working throughout the day allowed me to travel when the sun was out, occasionally stopping by coffee shops throughout the day to collaborate with my APAC (Asia Pacific) teammates.",
  "work_2": "Looking back, this strategy kept me sane. It helped with the loneliness of travelling alone, and gave me physical rest from walking destination to destination. The flexible work schedule did take a heavy toll on my wallet, as I had to drink a LOT of coffee throughout the trip (stay tuned for a Japan coffee shop tier list and reviews later on). My pocket wifi was great in most locations, and coffee shop or hostel wifis were almost always reliable, meaning I had little difficulty with connecting to the internet. However, the company VPN proved to be a little more than an annoyance, continuingly disconnecting me or having issues connecting in the first place.",
