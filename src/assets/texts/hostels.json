    "description": "This hostel is decently close to Sapporo Station, the main train station in Sapporo. It's a bit small but was very homey, with a nice common area and living space. The bed bunk had enough height for me and the width was decent as well. Some downsides include that there was no free security box and the showers were limited. Other than that, the hostel is located in a very peaceful and quiet area and the staff that I met were very nice and welcoming."

    "description": "Tune Hakodate Hostel is very hip. Advertised as a place for artists (mainly musicians), they have a stage in the store front for music performances. However, when I went there, maybe it was an off season as there were people performing but no one watching. The common area otherwise was very open and nice to work in, and the dorms were clean and comfy. There were plenty of individual showers and washrooms and a kitchen shared by everyone. The staff were nice but not as welcoming as some of the other locations I stayed at. The location is a bit far from the main Hakodate train station. I had to take a local bus that was convenient but may be difficult if you didn't understand any Japanese. The surrounding area had some convenience stores and smaller restaurants, and was walking distance to the water which is nice."

    "description": "This was more of a lower tier hotel rather than a hostel. It had more of a traditional front desk and the staff was very kind. The room was a nice change of pace to shared hostel rooms, with my own large bed and washroom. The location is great, found within downtown Aomori and with a good amount of shops and restaurants nearby. It was pretty difficult to find a hostel in Aomori since it's a smaller city with fewer foreigner travellers. The hotel was nothing spectacular but was a worry free and nice location for some quiet and alone time. "

    "description": "UNIZO is a hotel chain common across all of Japan. Similar to Aomori, Morioka is less travelled and was harder to find hostels to stay at. Instead, I found a nicely located UNIZO INN close to the main station, next to Shizukuishi River. There were not many restaurants nearby so I had a lot of meals at the closeby Family Mart convenience food. The room itself was small but comfy, good for one person travelling and requiring a place to stay for a short period of time."

    "description": "One of the few hostels available in Ishinomaki at the time, this hostel was a 30 minute train ride away from the main station. The hostel is located in a very residential area, in walking distance to the water. Because of this, they advertise for surfers and others that are active. The building itself was interesting architecturally, with only a second floor where the rooms were located. The rooms were small and simple, with two bunk beds, not much walking room in between and one mirror to share. The shared bathroom was next door so I would have to exit my room, lock the door, and then use the washroom. There weren't any other residents there outside of the one employee that seemed to manage the hostel. Overall, this spot was a very simple place with nothing too different or spectacular, but the surrounding immediate environment and beauty of the city made this stay much more comfortable."
