  "text": "I went to work as usual on the day of my flight, bringing everything with me. I was planning on taking Bart to get to the airport early so I could get a free meal. I recall staying at the Cathay Pacific Airways First and Business Class Lounge at SFO, taking a late team meeting while drinking some beer and eating a bag of Cheetos (btw the Wi-Fi password, if you’re near the lounge, is “cathay1234”). Here is how I looked on that day, alluring as usual with my disheveled hair and tiny lifeless eyes, ready for my 15-hour flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong."
