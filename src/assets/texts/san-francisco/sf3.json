  "text": "In terms of planning housing, I booked hostels for the first four or five locations and was planning to book as I go in case circumstances changed. HostelWorld is a great website for looking at hostels and they have availabilities in most cities I travelled to. They also have a pretty good cancellation policy in which I was able to cancel one a couple days in advance."
