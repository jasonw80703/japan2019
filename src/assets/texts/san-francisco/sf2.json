  "text": "A note about the JR pass: the maximum length JR pass is only 30 days and I was going to be travelling for around double that period, so I preordered two passes with specified dates. I thought I would have to go to a station and exchange the receipt for the pass on the exact day, but it seems that they are lenient about what actual day you exchange it."
