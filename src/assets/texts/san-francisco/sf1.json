  "text": "I brought with me a new 40L backpack that I purchased for the trip and a small cylinder duffel my dad got me when I visited Canada last. I packed a couple of days ahead, with the goal of travelling light. I had all my work things: laptop, charger, work phone (which came in handy many times), work phone charger. Toiletries were bare, packing: toothbrush, toothpaste, nail cutter, face wash, hairbands, and a small and large towel. In terms of clothes, I brought enough clothes to last myself a week, with the intention of buying clothes in Japan if needed. I packed 5 shirts, one long pair of pants, some shorts, a hat, and my backup glasses. In terms of miscellaneous items, I also brought a coin purse (because I was going to use a lot of cash), a notebook and pen (for journaling), my camera to take pictures, some elastic bands, plastic bags, the pocket Wi-Fi receipt, and my JR exchange passes that I preordered as well."
