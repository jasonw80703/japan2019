  "description": "Sapporo was my first city on the trip. It is a peaceful city surrounded by white capped mountains. It is the main city in Hokkaido, a prefecture in the northernmost islands of Japan. Sapporo is famous for the annual Snow Festival which I unfortunately couldn't attend since I was there in October. Even in October, the weather was surprisingly cold and prompted me to purchase a thick winter jacket.",
